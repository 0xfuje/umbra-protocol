stuff to note:

- these tests are using web3js not ethers.
  we should use the hardhat-web3 plugin or whatever we do on cozy.
  Or they should be switched to ethers.
- typechain is new for me. it generates ethers style types, or something.
- describe, before, etc mocha stuff is highlighted red!
- tests are written in js, rest of contracts folder is ts
