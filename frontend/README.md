# Umbra App

Send and receive stealth payments with the Umbra protocol.

## Development

1. Create a file called `.env` and populate it with the contents of `.env.template`
2. Fill in the `.env` file with your Infura ID. You only need the Portis and Fortmatic API keys if you plan on using those wallets
3. Install dependencies with `yarn`
4. Build for development with `yarn run dev`
